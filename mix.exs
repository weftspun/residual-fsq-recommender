  # Standalone Burrito binary (`rfr`), following the
  # V-Sekai-fire/multiplayer-fabric-taskweft pattern: the wrap step only
  # invokes Burrito when a zig toolchain is present (or RFR_BURRITO=1 forces
  # it), so a plain `mix release rfr` still assembles without the toolchain.
  # The BundleStep patch step downloads the matching versitygw single binary
  # per target and lands it in the payload's priv/versitygw/. It used to carry
  # a cockroach binary beside it, and the database is remote now.
